Report
We have Travis working now, so we will get more points back for documentation. There was some refactoring miscommunication,
so we will make sure to get a regrade for that. I also did not see that we had to commit this document, so I am doing that now.
I also forgot to change the report number, and have already made that change so that we won't get points off. We are really
happy with how we did. 

Features 
We are really happy with how we've done with the features as well. We have some testing that we have to add to our
existing implementation, and we have to change some of the features that we started last sprint. The list re-ordering
must be drag and drop or using buttons to move it. The UI only needs a few small changes to give it a sleeker feeling.
The pagination needs to look more like Google. Prior search results must have mini collages and titles from all the previous
searches (with a scroll bar if it's too long) on the results page of the current search. We envision that this will not be too
easy, but we know we can do it.
