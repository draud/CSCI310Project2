Mockup

Input box fo the radius feature instead of drop down
Hover: “radius of search”
Make restaurants section on Salad page, make each of the results their own tab
Print page, dropdown, back to be orange
Same for buttons on cake page
Background color for list name or line around for list name items

LogIn Function
Login appears to create new user — make this error more obvious that login isn’t working (pop-up window?)
Must have https in url
Access to any page must be protected by login - cannot just go to a url for a page
Password hash is good
FORM SUBMISSION:
Error from backend isn’t being passed to the right place to give an error at the frontend
If they try to login with the wrong password, display error message in red

Save Sessions are great
Hover text for number of items to show on page is great
Hover text for the radius as well

Radius
Integer for radius is fine
Must be in miles, which we did
No requirements as to how to indicate miles

Search history must persist across sessions
Groceries information must also persist

List Page Feature
Search Page
If no results, show an error message below the restaurant portion ONLY
Error message should be in red

Full points in filtering based on radius, maintaining three lists, password hashing

Need error messages, don’t have tests to ensure every page is accessible only after login, change radius input, SSL https, prior search lists and grocery list → add, error message for small radius and there is nothing there (O results)
